# InterviewCrew Platform

Welcome to the InterviewCrew Platform! This project aims to streamline and enhance the technical interview process.

## Project Organization

- **Project Plan**: See `prompt_plan.md` for the detailed development blueprint and LLM prompts guiding the project.
- **TODO List**: Track the project's progress and outstanding tasks in `todo.md`.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
